# AniBase

AniBase turns your local anime folders into a private streaming library: browse posters, continue episodes, track progress, generate thumbnails/subtitles, and keep everything running quietly from a Windows tray app.

It is built for personal collections first. Your media stays on your machine, runtime data lives in your Windows user profile, and the web dashboard is served locally by the app.

## Requirements

* 🌐 Internet connection for metadata.
* 🟣 Optional: Discord desktop app for Rich Presence.
* 🎬 Install **K-Lite Codec Pack Full** if videos appear blank or cannot be played in the browser.

## Installation & Setup

Choose one path:
* 🚀 **Release** if you only want to use AniBase.
* 🛠️ **Developer** if you want to run from source and use the project-local cache.
* 📦 **Build Release** if you want to create `AniBase.exe`.

### 🚀 Release

**Step 1: Download or Unpack**

[**Download AniBase for Windows**](https://github.com/anzutm/anibase-local/releases/tag/v2026.07.13)

Download the Windows ZIP from the release assets, extract it, then run `AniBase.exe`.

**Step 2: Run the Application**

```text
AniBase.exe
```

**Step 3: Open the Dashboard**

Open the dashboard from the tray, or visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000
```

Release builds store settings, database, watch history/status, cache, logs, and temp files in:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\AniBase\
```

### 🛠️ Developer

The setup script creates `.venv`, installs all Python dependencies, and makes
sure FFmpeg and FFprobe are available:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/anzutm/anibase-local.git
cd anibase-local
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_dev.ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Run AniBase from the project folder:

```powershell
$env:ANIBASE_USE_PROJECT_RUNTIME="1"
pythonw tray_ui.py
or
python main.py
```

With `ANIBASE_USE_PROJECT_RUNTIME` enabled, AniBase uses the data stored in
the repository instead of `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AniBase\`, including:

```text
cache\
logs\
temp\
```

Open the dashboard from the tray or visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000
```

### 📦 Build Release

**Step 1: Prepare the Developer Environment**

Complete the **Developer** setup first. The build script uses the same virtual environment and the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

**Step 2: Build the Release**

```powershell
python build.py --exe-only
```

**Step 3: Locate the Release Output**

The build target is `onedir` and `windowed`. The release folder is:

```text
releases\AniBase v<version>\
```

## First Setup

On a fresh runtime directory, AniBase opens the setup flow. Add your folders and preferences:

* 📁 Library folder paths.
* 🎬 Movies folder path.
* 📥 Auto-import paths, if used.
* 🎞️ Media Player executable path, if used.
* 🟣 Discord Rich Presence, if used.
* 🎨 Theme preset preference.
* 🌐 LAN access preference.

## Playback Troubleshooting

If the player opens but the video is blank or does not play, install the
**K-Lite Codec Pack Full**, restart Windows, then try playing the video again.
This is only required for media formats or codecs that are not already
supported by the user's Windows/browser configuration.

## Notes

* 🏠 AniBase is intended for personal local-library use only.
* 🔐 Do not expose the Flask development server directly to the public internet.
* 🧳 Keep runtime data, cache, logs, and local media out of Git and release bundles.
* 🎬 Windows releases bundle FFmpeg and FFprobe; the external Media Player remains optional.
* 💾 Normal release usage stores data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AniBase\`.
* 🛠️ Developer runtime mode stores data in this repository's `cache/` and `logs/` folders.
